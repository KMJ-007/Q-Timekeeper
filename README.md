## CPU scheduling algorithm
- i wrote all the cpu scheduling algorithm in pure c
- it was fun and good experiance
- the challange was to show the gantt chart of process in graphic, for which the instruction was to use graphic.h, because it was not wokring on my pc, i used raylib, which is awseome!

the chart is now only connected with demo one, was little lazy to connect with other algos, all algos are working!

## what i learned ?
- how import, export of code from one file to another works in c
- how to use struct
- how make file works(this was my first one)
- how raylib works
- how graphics works with raylib

### following algo are implmented:
- FCFS
- SJF(preemptive & non-preemptive)
- priority(preemptive & non-preemptive)
- round robbin


### I was the only one among the 200 students to implment this algo with graphics, i taught others after the class!

the guy in the image is just star trek reference, if you are also fan then would love to have chat with you!
